# Megaventory API Integration

This project enables adding products, suppliers/clients, and inventory locations using the Megaventory API. It also allows creating relationships between products and suppliers/clients, and updating product stocks.

## Project Description

This project "megaventory-api-integration" is related to my previous project named "mekanbul" listed on my CV.

MekanBul was a web application developed for finding and reviewing local businesses. It required integrating various APIs to fetch business information, manage user reviews, and handle location-based searches. The experience gained from that project, especially in terms of API integration and data management, was crucial in developing this project.
